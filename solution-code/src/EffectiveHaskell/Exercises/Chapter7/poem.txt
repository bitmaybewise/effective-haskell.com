Once was a parrot, George by name,
Who played a quite unusual game.
A fervent coder, to our surprise,
In love with Haskell's neat disguise.

"Good day," George squawks, takes his stance,
In lines of Haskell code, he'd dance.
From loops to functions, night and day,
In data types, George would play.

George wasn't your typical bird,
His love for code, it was absurd.
"Skip the cracker, bring me scripts,
Watch my joy in coding flips!"

George, oh George, so bright and clever,
In the world of bugs, he'd never waver.
His playground wasn't skies or trees,
But the logic of his machine's keys.

"Give me Haskell," cries George in glee,
His feathers twitching with pure spree.
The joy of coding he implores,
Syntax sugar, he adores.

So here's to George, with his might,
Coding Haskell, day and night.
Remember him when you hear a squawk,
It's George the Parrot, in code talk.
