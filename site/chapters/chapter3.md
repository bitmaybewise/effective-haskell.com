## Getting Started with Types

Haskell is a statically typed language, and a great deal of the benefit of
Haskell, and the innovation that it brings to practical programming, is the
power and expressiveness of its type system. Working with the type system is
the best, and often only, way to write programs in Haskell.

In this chapter you'll learn about some of Haskell's popular built in types,
and how to create types made up of other types, like lists of numbers. You'll
also learn how to create type annotations, how to read type errors, and how to
use ghci to inspect types interactively.

After you've read this chapter you'll be able to specify the types for values
and functions and be able to work with the compiler to troubleshoot problems
with your program that the type system can help you identify.

In the next chapter you'll learn how to define your own types and use them in
your programs.
