### Deserializing Heterogenous Data

Parsing and deserialize is another ubiquitous problem in modern computing, and
it's a class of problem Haskell is particularly well suited to solving.

In this chapter you'll learn how to apply what you've learned so far about
`Functors`, `Applicatives`, and `Monads` to build tools that will let you parse
a variety of different types of data.

Once you've finished this chapter, you'll be able to build rich and expressive
libraries to work with many different kinds of data. You'll also be able to
understand how existing some of the most popular parsing libraries in Haskell
are built.

In the next chapter you'll learn about mutable data. The work that you do in
this chapter will be useful both on it's own, as well as serve as a useful
stepping stone into understanding how the State monad handles mutable data.
