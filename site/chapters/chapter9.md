### Introducing Monads

The Functor, Applicative, and Monad typeclasses are pervasive across Haskell
programs. These type classes help you address a wide variety of extremely
common problems that arise when writing any number of real world programming
problems.

You'll learn about monads, applicatives, and functors and what laws govern
them. You'll also learn more about how to work with IO actions, and how to
make use of other common data types, like the optional Maybe type.

You'll be able to work effectively with any datatype that is a functor,
applicative, or monad, and define your own instances for these type classes.

Throughout the remainder of this book we'll make use of these typeclasses
regularly.
