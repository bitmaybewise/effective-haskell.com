### Creating and Structuring Haskell Projects

Modularity is the key to building large applications in any language. This
chapter will give you the information you need to be able to build large scale
Haskell applications, both by creating your own modules to allow you to organize
and reuse your code, as well as by making use of libraries developed by others.

You'll learn how to use Haskell's cabal tool to define, build, and run larger
applications that are made up of multiple files and include external
dependencies.

You'll be able to make use of the extensive collection of libraries available on
hackage to write new programs, and to build applications that you can easily
build and distribute.

In the next few chapters you'll start work on larger applications and will begin
to make use of some of the common core Haskell libraries that are not included
with the base system. As you start to build these large applications you'll need
to learn how to build projects and import dependencies.
