summary: "
In this chapter you'll learn how to create new records to hold related pieces
of data, how to use algebraic data types to encode the shape and structure of
your data in a data type, and how to create aliases so that you can provide

### Creating New Types

Haskell's type system gives you the power to create your own types and use
them to write better more correct applications.

In this chapter you'll learn how to create new records to hold related pieces
of data, how to use algebraic data types to encode the shape and structure of
your data in a data type, and how to create aliases so that you can provide
custom names for existing types.

After you've completed this chapter you'll be able to define custom data types
to reflect the data in your application. You'll also build a simple command
line calculator application to better understand how to use Haskell's type
system as a core part of writing applications.

In the next chapter you'll learn how to create your own modules and libraries,
including how to export your own data types and make them available to people
who are using your libraries and modules. In the following chapter you'll
learn about type classes, which allow you to describe types by their
behaviors.
