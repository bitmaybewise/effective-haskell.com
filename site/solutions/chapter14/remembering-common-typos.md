## Remembering Common Typos {.problem}

When a user is typing a long document, it's common that they will make certain
mistakes many times. For example, a user might habitually omit particular double
letters, or be prone to transposing certain letter sequences (for example typing
“teh” instead of “the”). Update your spell checker to remember misspellings and
their corrections, rather than doing a complete search each time the misspelling
is encountered.
