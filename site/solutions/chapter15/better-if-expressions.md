## Better If Expressions {.problem}

Earlier in the chapter you implemented conditionals inside of type families
using `IfThenElse`. Instead of making this a single type family, try to use a
mixture of GADTs and Type Families to explore other ways to encode conditionals
that give you more flexibility, or more closely resemble term level
conditionals.
