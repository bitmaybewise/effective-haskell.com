## Type Level Map {.problem}

Write a type family named `Map` that works like the term level `map`
function. It should allow you to apply a function to each element of a type
level list. Next, add a new type or type family so that you can add a number to
each element of a type level list of naturals, as in this example:

```haskell
Î» :kind! Map (Add 5) [0,1,2,3,4]
Map (Add 5) [0,1,2,3,4] :: [Natural]
= '[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
