The factorial function is a simple function that you can define
recursively. You can compute the factorial of a number, `n`, by
multiplying all of the numbers up to `n`. For example:

```haskell
factorial 5 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

Try implementing your own `factorial` function. You can
test your implementation in `ghci` and compare its output to the example:

```
λ factorial 1
1
λ factorial 3
6
λ factorial 5
120
λ factorial 10
3628800
λ factorial 25
15511210043330985984000000
```
