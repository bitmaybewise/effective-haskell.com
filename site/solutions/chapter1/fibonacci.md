## The Fibonacci Sequence {.problem}

The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that can be defined
recursively. The first 10 numbers of the fibonacci sequences are:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34. You can calculate any given fibonacci number,
`n`, by adding up the two previous fibonacci numbers.

Write a function that will compute the nth fibonacci number for any given
number, n. You can test your implementation in `ghci` and compare it to the
example:

```
λ fibonacci 0
0
λ fibonacci 1
1
λ fibonacci 5
5
λ fibonacci 10
55
λ fibonacci 25
75025
```
