## Pretty Printing and Parsing {.problem}

Reversible parsing is a technique that lets you write a parser that can also be
used to encode data. This is particularly useful when you want to impelement
parsing for files like json, XML, or our own `FilePack` format. A common use for
reversible parsing is to implement a “pretty printing” tool that will let users
re-format a document so that it's more readable.

Using what you've learned in this chapter, try to implement a parser for a
simple plain text format, and then make the parser reversible. Your reversible
parser should reformat the original input so that it's easier to read.
