## Command Line Argument Parsing {.problem}

Several of the examples that you've worked on in this book have required you to
deal with command line arguments. So far, we've dealt with this in an ad-hoc
manner. Using what you've learned in this chapter, try to build a library to
make it easier to work with command line arguments. Use this library to improve
the command line argument handling for your filepack parsing program and the
hcat application you built earlier.
