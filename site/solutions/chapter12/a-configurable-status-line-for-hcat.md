## A Configurable Status Line for HCat {.problem}

Using what you've learned in this chapter, revisit the hcat application that you
built earlier. Update hcat to support a configurable status bar that will show
up at the bottom of the output. The status bar configuration should be stored on
disk in a configuration file (for example `~/.config/hcat.conf`). Allow users to
specify which fields they want to see, what order they should appear in, and the
maximum width of each field.
