## Building A Word Replacement Utility {.problem}

Write an application that will accept three arguments on the command line:

- `path`: The path to a file
- `needle`: A word to find in the input file
- `replacement`: A word to use as a replacement when printing the file

When a user runs your program, you should print out the contents of the file at
`path`, but replace all occurrences of `needle` with `replacement` in the
output. To make things easier, assume that you can use the `words` function and
don't need to worry about handling multiple spaces or words that span lines.
