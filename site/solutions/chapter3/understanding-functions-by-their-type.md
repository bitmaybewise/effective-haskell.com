## Understanding Functions By Their Type {.problem}

The behavior of the following functions from base can be easily predicted based
on their type. Review the type of each of these functions and try to guess at
how they are implemented. Use `ghci` to see if you were right. Are there other
ways you could have implemented them? Why or why not?

- `Data.Tuple.swap :: (a,b) -> (b,a)`
- `concat :: [[a]] -> [a]`
- `id :: a -> a`
